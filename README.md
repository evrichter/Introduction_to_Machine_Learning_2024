# Introduction to Machine Learning (WS 2024/25)

This repository contains my solutions to assignments from the *Introduction to Machine Learning with Python* (NPFL129) course at Charles University, ÚFAL, winter semester 2024/25.  
The course covers both the theoretical foundations and hands-on implementation of core machine learning methods.  

## Topics
1. **Introduction to Machine Learning** — basic principles, manual linear regression, feature-based regression.  
2. **Linear Regression & SGD** — regularization (L2), stochastic gradient descent, feature engineering, rental price prediction.  
3. **Perceptron & Logistic Regression** — perceptron algorithm, logistic regression with SGD, model selection via grid search, thyroid disease classification.  
4. **Multiclass Logistic Regression & MLP** — softmax classification, multilayer perceptrons, MNIST image classification.  
5. **MLP & Evaluation Metrics** — multilabel classification, maximum entropy view of softmax, F1 score, diacritization task.  
6. **Text Representations** — TF-IDF, Word2Vec, sentiment analysis, dictionary-based diacritization.  
7. **Classical ML Algorithms** — k-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes, irony detection.  
8. **Correlation & Model Combination** — evaluation metrics, model ensembling, miniaturization competition.  
9. **Decision Trees & Random Forests** — tree-based methods and ensemble classification.  
10. **Gradient Boosted Decision Trees** — boosting methods, human activity recognition.  
11. **Dimensionality Reduction & Clustering** — SVD, PCA, k-means, natural language inference.  
12. **Statistical Testing & Model Comparison** — bootstrap resampling, permutation tests.
